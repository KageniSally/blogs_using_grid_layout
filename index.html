                    <p class="testimony">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking
                        to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        structure from
                        professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to
                        <br>enroll by a
                        former
                        student of theirsbr who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire <br>

                        staff
                        did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br>
                        assistance. The
                        agile team
                        project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way
                        <br> that no
                        tutorial
                        could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of
                        my <br>
                        developent
                        experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after
                        receiving multiple <br>
                        offers.
